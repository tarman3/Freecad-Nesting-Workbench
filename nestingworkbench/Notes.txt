Notes for Nesting Workbench


#TODO

Nesting tool should only work on one layout object.

Place labels on upper bounds of shapes instead of at a fixed position. Leave the input
as a default (1mm)

Need a way to cancel simulation. If nest button pressed twice, first instance continues to run.

Symetry optimaztion for rotation checks


maximize overlap area 
check bounds overlap area

 Fix Minkowski nesting small objects in voids

 simulate Minkowski
 set Minkowski as defaulkt algo

 Minkowski performance

 Transform tool
Add color when mouseover
hotkey for rotation

dragging shape should affect optionally be able to affect other shapes. push them out of the away or magnetize them 
falloff radius - blender inspired, brush size
